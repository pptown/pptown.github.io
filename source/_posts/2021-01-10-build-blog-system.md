### GitHub Pages

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), your site hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

### Hexo

[Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in Markdown (or other markup languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds.

### Good Practice

1. Push your blog source code to main branch.

2. With [Github Actions](https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages), auto generate static files and push to deploy branch.

3. View your site.
